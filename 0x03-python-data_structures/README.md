## Description

The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on practice with data structures and lists in Python. Each task focuses on a specific topic related to data structures, such as tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries. The project covers different methods and functions for manipulating data in these list types.

These tasks were completed by Mohamed KADI, a software engineering student at ALX Cohort-13.
