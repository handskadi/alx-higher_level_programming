## Description

The purpose of this project is to introduce programming concepts and provide hands-on practice in handling errors and exceptions in Python. Each task focuses on a specific topic and involves coding, compiling, running, and handling errors and exceptions in Python. By completing these tasks, you will gain familiarity with error handling and exception handling in the Python programming language and its various features.

These tasks were completed by Mohamed KADI, a software engineer student at ALX Cohort-13.
