## 1. Python Hello World

The **Python Hello World** directory contains a collection of small projects that serve as an introduction to programming in Python. Each task focuses on a specific topic and covers various coding exercises.

Functions and Code Examples:
- `hello_world()`: A function that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- `calculate_sum(a, b)`: A function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

## 2. Python If Else Loops Functions

The **Python If Else Loops Functions** directory contains a collection of small projects focused on if-else statements, loops, and functions in Python. These tasks provide hands-on practice in these programming concepts and improve problem-solving skills.

Functions and Code Examples:
- `is_even(num)`: A function that takes a number as input and returns `True` if it is even, and `False` otherwise.
- `print_numbers(n)`: A function that prints numbers from 1 to `n` using a loop.
- `calculate_factorial(n)`: A function that calculates the factorial of a given number `n`.

## 3. Python Import Modules

The **Python Import Modules** directory contains a collection of small projects that explore the usage of modules and the import function in Python. These tasks cover different functionalities related to module usage and provide practice in importing functions and variables.

Functions and Code Examples:
- `calculate_circle_area(radius)`: A function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. This function can be imported from a separate module.
- `convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit)`: A function that converts a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius. This function can be imported from a separate module.

## 4. Python Data Structures

The **Python Data Structures** directory contains a collection of small projects focused on data structures and lists in Python. These tasks cover various types of data structures, such as tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries. They provide practice in manipulating data in these list types.

Functions and Code Examples:
- `get_unique_elements(lst)`: A function that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements.
- `calculate_average(numbers)`: A function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.
- `find_largest(dictionary)`: A function that finds the key with the largest value in a dictionary.

## 5. Python More Data Structures

The **Python More Data Structures** directory contains a collection of small projects focused on additional data structures and lists in Python. These tasks cover additional types of data structures and provide further practice in manipulating data in these list types.

Functions and Code Examples:
- `sort_strings(strings)`: A function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with the strings sorted alphabetically.
- `remove_duplicates(lst)`: A function that removes duplicate elements from a list.
- `reverse_dictionary(dictionary)`: A function that reverses the keys and values of a dictionary.

## 6. Python Exceptions

The **Python Exceptions** directory contains a collection of small projects focused on error handling and exceptions in Python. These tasks cover various aspects of error handling, including handling specific exceptions, raising exceptions, and handling errors with custom messages.

Functions and Code Examples:
- `divide_numbers(a, b)`: A function that divides two numbers and handles the `ZeroDivisionError` exception.
- `open_file(filename)`: A function that opens a file and handles the `FileNotFoundError` exception.
- `validate_age(age)`: A function that validates the age input and raises a `ValueError` if the age is invalid.
